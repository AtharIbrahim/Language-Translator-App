# 📚 Language Translator App

Back with my latest learning

Welcome! I'm excited to share my latest learning experience: an **Language Translator** built with Java and XML. In my role as the developer of Language Translator, I created an app to enable effortless communication across languages, perfect for travelers and language enthusiasts. Built using Java & XML for a responsive user interface, with Google Cloud APIs powering translation accuracy, and Firebase for managing translation history, the app offers instant text and voice translations, text-to-speech for pronunciation, and a history log for quick reference. A premium option adds an ad-free experience and extra features. The goal was to provide users with a seamless translation tool, strengthening my skills in development and efficient data handling.
